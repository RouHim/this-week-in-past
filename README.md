## Motivation

When I migrated my photo collection from google photos to a locally hosted instance of photoprism, I missed the
automatically generated slideshow feature of google photos, here it is now.

## How it works

The meta information of all images are read at startup and cached in memory. When the slideshow is opened, images from
this calendar week from previous years are displayed. If no images from the calendar year are found, random images are
displayed.

## Run the application

### Native execution

Download the latest release for your system from
the [releases page](https://github.com/RouHim/this-week-in-past/releases):

```shell
# Assuming you run a x86/x64 system, if not adjust the binary name to download 
LATEST_VERSION=$(curl -L -s -H 'Accept: application/json' https://github.com/RouHim/this-week-in-past/releases/latest | \
sed -e 's/.*"tag_name":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/') && \
curl -L -o this-week-in-past https://github.com/RouHim/this-week-in-past/releases/download/$LATEST_VERSION/this-week-in-past-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl && \
chmod +x this-week-in-past
```

Create a folder to store the application data:

```shell
mkdir data
```

Start the application with:

```shell
RESOURCE_PATHS=/path/to/pictures \
DATA_FOLDER=data \
SLIDESHOW_INTERVAL=60 \
./this-week-in-past
```

> Since the binary is compiled [completely statically](https://github.com/rust-cross/rust-musl-cross), there are no
> dependencies on system libraries like glibc.

### Docker

Docker Example:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
        -v /path/to/pictures:/resources \
        -e SLIDESHOW_INTERVAL=60 \
        -e WEATHER_ENABLED=true \
        -e OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY> \
        -e BIGDATA_CLOUD_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY> \
        rouhim/this-week-in-past
```

Docker compose example:

```shell
services:
  this-week-in-past:
    image: rouhim/this-week-in-past
    volumes:
      - /path/to/pictures:/resources:ro # mount read only
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      SLIDESHOW_INTERVAL: 10
```

## Configuration

### Ignoring folders

There are two ways to ignore folders:

1) By ignore file: If a folder contains a file with the name specified in `IGNORE_FOLDER_MARKER_FILES`, the folder is
   ignored.
2) By folder name: If a folder name matches the regular expression specified in `IGNORE_FOLDER_REGEX`, the folder is
   ignored.

> If a folder is ignored, all its sub-elements (files and folders) are also ignored.

## Limitations

* Due to [this issue](https://github.com/image-rs/image/issues/1375) of the image crate, there is currently no **HEIC**
  image support.

## Visual Interaction

The slideshow can be controlled by clicking on invisible zones on the screen. These zones are divided into three areas:

* **Previous Image**: Clicking on the left side of the screen will show the previous image.
* **Pause/Resume**: Clicking in the middle of the screen will pause or resume the slideshow.
* **Next Image**: Clicking on the right side of the screen will show the next image.

> The slideshow will automatically continue after the `REFRESH_INTERVAL` has passed.

## Performance

### Example 1

* Hardware: i3-12100T, 3xWD_BLACK SN750 (RAID-Z1), 32GB RAM
* Photos: ~80k
* Indexing: 6 seconds
* Uncached slideshow change: < 1 second

### Example 2

* Hardware: Raspberry Pi Model B, Class 10 SD Card, 1GHz (OC) 32-Bit arm/v6, 512MB RAM
* Photos: ~6k
* Indexing: 38 seconds
* Uncached slideshow change: ~7 seconds

### Example 3

* Hardware: LG G3 (Android Smartphone), Internal Storage, Snapdragon 801 4C 32-Bit arm/v7, 3GB RAM
* Photos: ~8k
* Indexing: 50 seconds
* Uncached slideshow change: < 1 second

> Indexing scales with storage performance

> Slideshow change scales with CPU performance
