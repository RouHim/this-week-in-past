## Motivation

When I migrated my photo collection from google photos to a locally hosted instance of photoprism, I missed the
automatically generated slideshow feature of google photos, here it is now.

## How it works

The meta information of all images are read at startup and cached in memory. When the slideshow is opened, images from
this calendar week from previous years are displayed. If no images from the calendar year are found, random images are
displayed.

## Performance

Hardware: i3-12100T, 3xWD_BLACK SN750 (RAID-Z1), 32GB RAM

Photos: ~80k

The first indexing when starting the application took about 6 seconds.

## Run the application

The application should be started as a container.

Docker Example:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
        -v /path/to/pictures:/resources \
        -e SLIDESHOW_INTERVAL=10 \
        -e WEATHER_ENABLED=true \
        -e OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY> \
        -e BIGDATA_CLOUD_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY> \
        rouhim/this-week-in-past
```

Docker compose example:

```shell
version: "3.9"

services:
  this-week-in-past:
    image: rouhim/this-week-in-past
    volumes:
      - ~/Pictures/:/resources:ro # should be read only
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via environment variables:
